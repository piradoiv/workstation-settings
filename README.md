# Work from anywhere!

I'm a software developer trying to work remotely from my tablet, 
it's a Motorola Xoom (Wingray).

Did you ever wanted to format your work's machine and you were
worried losing your whole workflow?, me too, that's why I want to
change to another way of working.

You'll only need any SSH client and Internet connection, and iPad
and a wireless keyboard will work like a charm!

## Is there any real life example?
Yup, take a look to these blog posts:

## What do you need?
Any SSH client, internet and a Virtual Private Server. I'm using
DigitalOcen, but Linode will work great as well.
